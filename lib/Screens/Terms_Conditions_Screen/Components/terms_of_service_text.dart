Some third-party service providers may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the third-party service provider's relevant terms for details.

Subject to any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable. And because our performance begins once you tap buy and we give you immediate access to your purchase, you waive any right you may have under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it's completed or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT MegaVideo IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.

Some of the Virtual Products we offer are for one-time use only, while others are for repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does not mean "forever." We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will bear no liability to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any Products you purchased through the Services.

It's your sole responsibility to manage your purchases.

MegaVideo does not transmit any funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, subject to that third party's separate Terms of Service.

MegaVideo offers in-app purchases ("IAP") through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by MegaVideo. If you choose to make an IAP, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your application platform, and your application platform account (e.g. iTunes Account) will be charged for the IAP in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for IAP that apply to your application platform account. Some application platforms may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription IAP, your application platform account will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel the IAP. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you can do so within the MegaVideo app or log in to your application platform account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the MegaVideo application from your device. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. Deleting your account on MegaVideo or deleting the MegaVideo application from your device does not cancel your subscription; MegaVideo will retain all funds charged to your application platform until you cancel your subscription.

Generally, all charges for IAP are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.

To request a refund: If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not MegaVideo. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit "Report Problem". You can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.

If you subscribed using your Google Play Store account: please contact Google Play customer support with your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google Wallet)."""

Without limiting any of the foregoing, our maximum liability or responsibility to you is to refund the Coins lost. You may from time to time be presented with opportunities to redeem Coins. We will, in our sole discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate for any Coins, which may be modified at any time.

All claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and MegaVideo are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
 
  - Arbitration Rules.United States Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the United States International Economic and Trade Arbitration (“USIETAC”). If the USIETAC is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.
 
  - Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
 
  - Authority of the Arbitrator..The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and MegaVideo. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and MegaVideo.
 
  - Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.
 
  - Confidentiality. No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
 
  - Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.
 
  - Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor MegaVideo can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify MegaVideo in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your MegaVideo username and the email address you used to set up your MegaVideo account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.
 
  - Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or MegaVideo may bring an individual action in small claims court.
 
  - Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with MegaVideo."""
